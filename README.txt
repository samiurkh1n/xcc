Samiur's Experiments in C++

All of these instructions are for future Samiur when he inevitably forgets.

Requires: CMake, most C++ compilers (g++, clang, msvc-cl.exe).

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Each file explores one keyword or concept in C++
e.g. explicit.cpp will explain what the explicit keyword is with an example of where it [doesn't] work.

Note: rule of zero won't compile since it tries to emulate parts of WinAPI. Use as conceptual review.
