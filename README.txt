Samiur's Experiments in C++

All of these instructions are for future Samiur when he inevitably forgets.

Requires: Windows DevCmd and/or MSVC compiler.

Build: Targets are commented out in build.bat. Uncomment what you want to experiment with and run build.bat.

Each file explores one keyword or concept in C++ e.g. explicit.cpp will explain what the explicit keyword is with an example of where it [doesn't] work.
